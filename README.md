## Mylisting360 - Description

MyListing360 is an easy to use Virtual Tour builder and hosting site for Real Estate Agents and Photographers. Visitors to the site are able to create a user account where they can build and host the tours via their user Dashboard. While in the Dashboard users can create a new tour or view their existing tours previously built. After a tour is fully built with Images and Descriptions a tour can then be shared on Facebook or Linkedin.

## `What Can you do?`

• Create a new User Account
• Log into an existing Account (contains your specific user Virtual Tours)
• Create a New Virtual Tour in the User Dashboard
• View/ Edit/ Delete each Virtual Tour via the User Dashboard
• When tours are Deleted from the User Dashboard they move to the User Trash can to await full Deletion.
• Tours in the user Trash Can can either be restored back to the User Dashboard or Permanently Deleted from the Database.
• Virtual Tours can also be "shared" to Facebook and LinkedIn directly from the Users Dashboard.
• Vitual Tours can be Navigated by changing rooms via the clickable buttons with the Room Names printed in them. When a button is clicked the image in the viewer changes to the appropriate room.
• A user can Logout (Have a great day!)

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
